# 01. Note of timing constraints

1. It get information of clock-path & speed from waveform of FPGA sim.
2. It can generate timing constraints(XDC) from DB with clock-path & speed.
3. We can count high-level and low-level in DB.

(idea example)
1. set system clock : 1Ghz
2. stream of waveform : 1111000011110000
3. high/low-level(number of repeat) : 1(4) -> 0(4) -> 1(4) -> 0(4)
4. calculator frequency
