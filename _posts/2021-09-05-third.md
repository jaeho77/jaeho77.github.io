# 01. Note for IP-XACT

https://www.accellera.org/downloads/standards/ip-xact

Overview of Generated IP-XACT File
The TLM generator automatically generates an IP-XACT file that complies with IEEE® Standard for IP-XACT 1685-2009. You can find this file in the same folder as the generated makefile.

The generated IP-XACT file contains the following:

Mapping information between Simulink® and the generated TLM component.

Metadata specific to MathWorks® and the model. This data is intended primarily for reference, but it is required when importing the file for TLM generation.
